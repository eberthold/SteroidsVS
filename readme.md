__Code Quality Hints__

The code quality hints displays warnings in code right where they belong, to make it easier to detect them.
Currently its only shows warnings generated by VisualStudio and Roslyn Analyzers.

In addition it features a overall indicator, if your file is good, has warnings or errors.
Inside this indicator it informs you about the count of elements (fields, methods, properties) in your code. That count is purely informational without judgement on your code ;)

__Code Structure__

The code structure helps to navigate through large files quickly by listing all elements grouped - as recommended from StyleCop - and alphabetically ordered per group.

The shortcut is defaulted to ctrl-e + ctrl-s or simply click on the quality indicator in the bottom right corner.
